/**
 * Database settings:
 *
 * The $databases array specifies the database connection or
 * connections that Drupal may use.  Drupal is able to connect
 * to multiple databases, including multiple types of databases,
 * during the same request.
 *
 * One example of the simplest connection array is shown below. To use the
 * sample settings, copy and uncomment the code below between the @code and
 * @endcode lines and paste it after the $databases declaration. You will need
 * to replace the database username and password and possibly the host and port
 * with the appropriate credentials for your database system.
 *
 * The next section describes how to customize the $databases array for more
 * specific needs.
 *
 * @code
 * $databases['default']['default'] = [
 *   'database' => 'database_name',
 *   'username' => 'sql_username',
 *   'password' => 'sql_password',
 *   'host' => 'localhost',
 *   'port' => '3306',
 *   'driver' => 'mysql',
 *   'prefix' => '',
 *   'collation' => 'utf8mb4_general_ci',
 * ];
 * @endcode
 */

$databases['default']['default'] = array (

/**
 * Trusted host configuration.
 *
 * Drupal core can use the Symfony trusted host mechanism to prevent HTTP Host
 * header spoofing.
 *
 * To enable the trusted host mechanism, you enable your allowable hosts
 * in $settings['trusted_host_patterns']. This should be an array of regular
 * expression patterns, without delimiters, representing the hosts you would
 * like to allow.
 *
 * For example:
 * @code
 * $settings['trusted_host_patterns'] = [
 *   '^www\.example\.com$',
 * ];
 * @endcode
 * will allow the site to only run from www.example.com.
 *
 * If you are running multisite, or if you are running your site from
 * different domain names (eg, you don't redirect http://www.example.com to
 * http://example.com), you should specify all of the host patterns that are
 * allowed by your site.
 *
 * For example:
 * @code
 * $settings['trusted_host_patterns'] = [
 *   '^example\.com$',
 *   '^.+\.example\.com$',
 *   '^example\.org$',
 *   '^.+\.example\.org$',
 * ];
 * @endcode
 * will allow the site to run off of all variants of example.com and
 * example.org, with all subdomains included.
 *
 * @see https://www.drupal.org/docs/installing-drupal/trusted-host-settings
