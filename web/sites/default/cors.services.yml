    # Specifies allowed headers and sets the Access-Control-Allow-Headers
    # header. For example, ['X-Custom-Header']. See

    allowedHeaders: ['*']
    # Specifies allowed request methods and sets the
    # Access-Control-Allow-Methods header. For example, ['POST', 'GET',
    # 'OPTIONS'] or ['*'] to allow all. Note the wildcard is not yet implemented
    # in all browsers. See
    # https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Methods
    allowedMethods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PATCH', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS']
    # Configure requests allowed from specific origins and sets the
    # Access-Control-Allow-Origin header. For example,
    # ['https://www.drupal.org'] or ['*'] to allow any origin to access your
    # resource. See

    allowedOrigins: ['*']
    # Sets the Access-Control-Expose-Headers header. The default is false which
    # means the header will not be set. To set the header use a comma delimited
    # list within square brackets. For example, ['Content-Type', 'Expires'] or
    # ['*'] to expose all headers. Setting exposedHeaders: ['*'] will result in
    # a Access-Control-Expose-Headers: * response header. See

    exposedHeaders: ['true']
    # Setting Access-Control-Max-Age header value to '0' or false will omit this
    # from the response. However, setting it to '-1' will explicitly disable
    # caching. For example, setting the value to 600 will cache results of a
    # preflight request for 10 minutes. See
